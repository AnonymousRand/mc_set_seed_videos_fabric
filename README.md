# Fabric Mod Implementation of Set Seed Videos Modded Clients
For 1.16.1

Mod used for unofficial set seed runs at Iseburg https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeCT_BJS_o2avWBNiXxEk2w

# Installation instructions:

1. Click on "Releases" near the right side of the screen
2. Download the jar file from the release you want under the "Assets" tab (unlike with modded clients, you do not need to download the source code zip files; those only provide the code for the mod and not the runnable file itself)
3. Put the jar file into your mods folder in .minecraft (default location of .minecraft can be accessed by pressing WindowsKey + R and typing in "%AppData%" without the quotation marks)
4. Download both [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/3049057) for 1.16.1 and follow their installation instructions (run the exe for Fabric Loader and drop the Fabric API jar file into the mods folder)
5. Launch the game using a Fabric loader installation and the mod should be loaded (compatible with Java 8. 14, 15, 16, and 17)

This is a mod made with Fabric API, not a modded client, so the code can be shared as it does not include code from the actual game files.

Remove both this mod and Fabric API from your mods folder if you are looking to submit actual speedruns as they are not allowed.
